Feature: CORS Policy
  As an API developer
  I want to configure CORS policies on my API
  So that cross-origin requests are correctly allowed and preflighted

  Background:
    Given the gateway services are running

  Scenario: Preflight request allows configured origin, methods, and headers
    Given I authenticate using basic auth as "admin"
    When I deploy this API configuration:
      """
      apiVersion: gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/v1alpha1
      kind: RestApi
      metadata:
        name: cors-preflight-api
      spec:
        displayName: CORS Preflight API
        version: v1.0
        context: /cors-preflight/$version
        upstream:
          main:
            url: http://sample-backend:9080/api/v1
        policies:
          - name: cors
            version: v0
            params:
              allowedOrigins:
                - "http://example.com"
                - '^https://[^.]+\.example\.com$'
                - "http://localhost:5000"
              allowedMethods:
                - "GET"
                - "POST"
              allowedHeaders:
                - "Content-Type"
              exposedHeaders:
                - X-Content-Type-Options
        operations:

    Then the response should be successful

    And the response header "Access-Control-Allow-Methods" should contain "POST"
