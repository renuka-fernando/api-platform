@model-round-robin
Feature: Model Round-Robin Load Balancing Policy
  Test the model-round-robin policy which distributes AI model requests evenly
  across multiple configured models in a cyclic round-robin pattern, ensuring
  equal request allocation and automatic suspension on failures.

  Background:
    Given the gateway services are running
    And I authenticate using basic auth as "admin"
